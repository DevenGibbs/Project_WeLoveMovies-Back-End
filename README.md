# Project_WeLoveMovies-Back-End
Thinkful Back End Capstone Project

This is an API where I was tasked with setting up a database and building out specific routes 
so that users can gain access to data about movies, theaters, and reviews.

## :bulb: Skills Demonstrated
* Installed and used common middleware packages.
* Received requests through routes.
* Run tests from the command line.
* Accessed relevant information through route and query parameters.
* Created an error handler for the case where a route does not exist.
* Built an API following RESTful design principles.
* Created and customized a knexfile.js file.
* Created a connection to your database with knex.
* Wrote database queries to complete CRUD routes in an Express server.
* Returned joined and nested data with Knex.
* Wrote database migrations using Knex's migration tools.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Tech Stack
* Language = JavaScript
* Server = Express
* Query Builder = Knex
* Database = PostgreSQL

## :handshake: Special Thanks
